            <h2>RULES ABANDON SHIP!!!!!!!</h2>
            <h6>In soccer there are 22 players, and there are 11 people in each team. Each team has a goalie, who protects their team's goal. The rest of the the players stand on their half of the field in an orderly fasion. Once they've done that, they can start the game. The starting of the game goes a little something like this: One person from each team stands in the middle of the field, and in between them is the Soccer ball. One person kicks the ball tothe other person and the game begins. You have to try to kick the ball into the other team's goal without the goalie blocking it to score a point. You can not touch the ball with your hand, but if you do, the other team get's to do a penalty kick. That means the person in the other team closest to the person who touched ball with his hands gets to kick the ball from that place without anyone moving, and vice versa. For one hour the game goes on, and whatever team that gets the most points wins the game.</h6>
